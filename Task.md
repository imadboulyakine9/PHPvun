## 50 Detailed Steps to Build a PHP WAF Simulator and Secure Login System

**Project Setup & Environment (Steps 1-5):**

1. **Install a Local Development Environment:**  Choose a suitable local server environment like XAMPP (Windows/macOS/Linux), WAMP (Windows), MAMP (macOS), or set up a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack manually.  Install the chosen environment and ensure Apache, MySQL, and PHP are running correctly.
2. **Create Project Directory:** Create a new folder for your project (e.g., "php-waf-auth").  This will be the root directory for all your project files.
3. **Create Subfolders for Organization:** Inside your project directory, create subfolders for different components: "waf" (for WAF files), "auth" (for authentication files), "includes" (for common functions or classes), and "logs" (for storing log files).
4. **Create Initial PHP Files:** Create empty files named `index.php` (main entry point), `waf.php` (WAF functions), `auth.php` (authentication functions), and `config.php` (configuration settings).
5. **Set Up Database (If Using):**  If you're using a database (highly recommended), install a database server (like MySQL) if you haven't already. Create a new database (e.g., "waf_auth_db").  Create a `database.sql` file to store your database schema (tables for users, logs, etc.).

**WAF Simulator Development (Steps 6-20):**

6. **Define WAF Rules (waf.php):**  Create an array or use a separate configuration file to store your WAF rules.  These rules will be regular expressions targeting SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.  Start with basic patterns and add more specific ones as you learn.
7. **Create `waf_filter()` Function (waf.php):** Define a function `waf_filter($input, $rules)` that accepts user input and an array of rules. This function will be the core of your WAF.
8. **Implement Regular Expression Matching (waf.php):** Inside `waf_filter()`, iterate through the provided rules and use `preg_match()` to check if the input matches any of the patterns.
9. **Handle Matches (waf.php):** If a match is found (potential attack), log the attack details (timestamp, IP address, requested URI, matched rule).  Use `error_log()` or write to a custom log file.
10. **Implement Blocking/Sanitizing (waf.php):** Decide whether to block the request entirely (e.g., returning a 403 error) or sanitize the input by removing or encoding potentially harmful characters (e.g., using `htmlspecialchars()` for XSS prevention).
11. **Test WAF with SQL Injection Payloads:**  Create test cases with various SQL injection payloads (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`, `UNION SELECT...`) to verify your WAF blocks them.
12. **Test WAF with XSS Payloads:** Test with XSS payloads like `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` and `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` to ensure proper filtering.
13. **Refine SQL Injection Rules (waf.php):**  Based on testing, add more specific and robust SQL injection patterns to your ruleset to catch more sophisticated attacks.
14. **Refine XSS Rules (waf.php):**  Similarly, refine your XSS rules to cover different XSS attack vectors (e.g., event handlers, encoded characters).
15. **Implement IP Address Logging (waf.php):**  Get the client's IP address using `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` (consider handling proxy servers) and include it in the log entries.
16. **Implement Request URI Logging (waf.php):**  Log the requested URI (`$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`) to identify the target of the attack.
17. **Implement Timestamp Logging (waf.php):** Include the current timestamp (using `date()`) in your log entries for accurate attack tracking.
18. **Consider a Logging Class (includes/Logger.php):**  For better organization, create a `Logger` class to handle logging operations, making your WAF code cleaner.
19. **Error Handling (waf.php):** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent revealing sensitive information in error messages.
20. **WAF Configuration Options (config.php):** Add configuration options (e.g., logging level, blocking vs. sanitizing) to `config.php` to control WAF behavior.

**Secure Authentication Development (Steps 21-40):**

21. **Create User Table (database.sql):** Design a database table to store user information (username, hashed password, MFA secret, etc.). Use appropriate data types and consider indexing for performance.
22. **Create Registration Form (index.php/register.php):** Create an HTML form for user registration. Include fields for username, password, and any other required information.
23. **Handle Registration (auth.php):**  In `auth.php`, write PHP code to process the registration form. Validate user input, hash passwords using `password_hash()` with bcrypt or Argon2, and store user data in the database.
24. **Create Login Form (index.php/login.php):** Create an HTML form for user login.
25. **Handle Login (auth.php):** Implement the login logic: Retrieve the user from the database based on the entered username, verify the password using `password_verify()`, and set session variables upon successful login.
26. **Implement Session Management:** Use PHP's session functions (`session_start()`, `$_SESSION`) to manage user sessions.
27. **Log Failed Login Attempts (auth.php):**  Log failed login attempts, including timestamp, IP address, and entered username, to help detect brute-force attacks.
28. **Implement Brute-Force Protection (auth.php):** Implement rate limiting or account locking after a certain number of failed login attempts from a specific IP address or for a particular user.
29. **Implement Logout (auth.php):**  Create a logout function to clear session variables and end the user's session.
30. **MFA Setup (Optional - auth.php):**  If implementing MFA, choose a method (TOTP, email/SMS OTPs) and integrate the necessary libraries or services.
31. **Generate MFA Secret (auth.php):**  Generate a unique MFA secret for each user during registration (if using TOTP).  Store the secret securely in the database.
32. **MFA Verification (auth.php):** Implement the logic to verify the OTP entered by the user against the stored MFA secret.
33. **Input Validation (auth.php):**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs (username, password, OTP, etc.) to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
34. **Password Complexity Requirements (auth.php):**  Enforce password complexity rules during registration (minimum length, required characters, etc.).
35. **Prepare SQL Statements (auth.php):**  Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities when interacting with the database.
36. **Secure Session Handling:**  Implement secure session management practices (e.g., regenerating session IDs, setting appropriate cookie flags like `HttpOnly` and `Secure`).
37. **Password Reset Functionality (Optional - auth.php):** Implement a secure password reset mechanism.
38. **Email Verification (Optional - auth.php):**  Verify user email addresses during registration to prevent fake accounts.
39. **Account Activation (Optional - auth.php):**  Activate user accounts after email verification.
40. **Test Authentication Thoroughly:** Test the registration, login, logout, and MFA functionality with various inputs and scenarios.

**Integration and Refinement (Steps 41-50):**

41. **Integrate WAF and Authentication (index.php):** Include `waf.php` and `auth.php` in `index.php`. Apply the `waf_filter()` function to all user inputs before processing them in the authentication logic.
42. **Protect Content (index.php):**  Check if the user is logged in (using session variables) before displaying protected content. Redirect to the login page if not authenticated.
43. **Implement Access Control:**  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if your application has different user roles with varying permissions.
44. **Centralize Error Handling:** Create a central error handling mechanism to gracefully handle errors and log them appropriately.
45. **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review to identify potential security vulnerabilities or logic errors.
46. **Security Testing:**  Use security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) to test for vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
47. **Performance Optimization:**  Optimize your code and database queries for performance.
48. **Documentation:**  Document your code and the overall architecture of your project.
49. **Deployment (Optional):**  Deploy your application to a web server for real-world testing or production use.
50. **Continuous Monitoring and Updates:**  Regularly monitor your application for security vulnerabilities and apply updates to your WAF rules and authentication mechanisms to stay protected against new threats.
